# nerf_synthetic_Unity

Making a [nerf_synthetic](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JDdLGDruGNXWnM1eqY1FNL9PlStjaKWi) format dataset in Unity.



## How to use

Just mount this script to the camera you used in the scene. It will randomly place the camera on the specified hemisphere with the camera's specified orientation, and the generated dataset will be saved to your project file directory.

Then you can use this to train NeRF or 3D-Gaussians.
